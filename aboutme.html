  <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
  <h2>BIO</h2>
  <p>I'm currently a senior in high school. I go to San Jose High School which apparently almost no one knows about. I'm a huge fan of Harry Potter and comics from the Marvel and DC Universes. I guess you could say I'm a social person as I love talking in general and I would say I'm artistically inclined as I also love to draw and make things look aesthetically pleasing. However, I'm a really messy person but I credit that to my creative personality always liking clutter. </p>
