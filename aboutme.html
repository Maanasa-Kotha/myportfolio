	  <p>Disclaimer: I don't know how to fix the photo it was worse before lol.</p>
  <p>I'm currently a senior in high school. I go to San Jose High School which apparently almost no one knows about. I'm a huge fan of Harry Potter and comics from the Marvel and DC Universes. I guess you could say I'm a social person as I love talking in general and I would say I'm artistically inclined as I also love to draw and make things look aesthetically pleasing. However, I'm a really messy person but I credit that to my creative personality always liking clutter. </p>

  <h4>Reflections</h4>
	  <p>Reflection Week 2.2</p>
	  <p> Python and Scratch both seem to be programming languages with the same concepts but Python is definitely harder in most aspects. 
	  Scratch has a GUI structure that is more dragging and dropping and fitting things together. If you understand basic programming concepts,
	  you should be good with Scratch. Python is more difficult because it requires exact syntax and knowing how to use a text editor to run the program.
	  There's a lot less given to you with Python.
		  
	  It was different today because it was more of a lecture oriented type of learning than a project based learning. There was more theory and concepts to learn
		  Than actual doing. I don't like it as much but I do understand it is necessary. Programming in Python is definitely harder because the syntax
	  messes you up so much but I like that we had more flexibility. It was also cool to really figure out how to spiral a shape properly with user input.</p>
	  <p>Reflection Week 2.5</p>
	  <p>A list is basically what it's called, a list. You can put a list of any types of variables whether it's other lists, tuple, integers, or strings. It's 
	     useful when you want to group a certain amount of data together and anaylze or change them We managed to create names, filters for images, and so much more.
	     I think my group today worked best together because we had fun together and had similar thinking processes and speed but different enough to be able to solve
	     the problems and get unique perspectives. We solved things extremely quickly in fact and I was very surprised. I like how powerful python can be and how easy 
	     it is to program in it. I love the types of problems you can solve with python and with this I discovered how much I love problem solving.</p>
